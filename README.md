<p>This project was made for solving the <strong>Find large palindromic prime number in the decimal expansion of π (3,1415…)</strong>.</p>
<p>The challenge was involved by 4 phases.</p> 
<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Find the first 9-digit palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Find the first 21-digit palindromic in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Find the largest palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p><strong>Final Phase:</strong> Find the next number given some sequence.</p>
