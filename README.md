<h1>Challege of Sigmageek</h1>

<p>This project was made for solving the <strong>Find large palindromic prime number in the decimal expansion of π (3,1415…)</strong>.</p>
<p>It consumes Pi.Delivery API, that delivers 100 Trillion Digits of Pi, by using a generator and creating a number using the number of digits passed.</p>

<h3>The challenge was involved by 4 phases.</h3> 
<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Find the first 9-digit palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Find the first 21-digit palindromic in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Find the largest palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p><strong>Final Phase:</strong> Find the next number given some sequence.</p>


<p>Actually, my project could not achieve the third and the last phase. I have started solvind third-phase but the deadline of the project arrived. </p>
