This project was made for solving the **Find large palindromic prime number in the decimal expansion of π (3,1415…)**.
The challenge was involved by 4 phases. Phase 1: Find the first 9-digit palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi;
Phase 2: Find the first 21-digit palindromic in the decimal expansion of Pi;
Phase 3: Find the largest palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi;
and Final Phase: Find the next number given some sequence.
