<p>This project was made for solving the **Find large palindromic prime number in the decimal expansion of π (3,1415…)**.</p>
<p>The challenge was involved by 4 phases.</p> 
<p>Phase 1: Find the first 9-digit palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p>Phase 2: Find the first 21-digit palindromic in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p>Phase 3: Find the largest palindromic prime in the decimal expansion of Pi</p>
<p>Final Phase: Find the next number given some sequence.</p>
